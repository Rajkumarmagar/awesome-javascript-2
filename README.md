## Web Frameworks

* [Express](http://expressjs.com) - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com) - The JavaScript App Platform. Build apps that are a delight to use, faster than you ever thought possible.

## Functional Programming

* [Underscrore](http://underscorejs.org/) - JavaScript library that provides a whole mess of useful functional programming helpers without extending any built-in objects.
* [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) - A modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance, & extras.
* [Lazy.js](http://danieltao.com/lazy.js/) - Similar to Underscore and Lodash, but with an underlying engine that supports many more use cases than those libraries, while offering comparable or superior performance in most scenarios.
